# Androidplot Documentation

Documentation is limited.  Your best resource
is the [DemoApp's example source code](../demoapp) as it's kept up to date for every release.  If you can't 
find an answer feel free to ask a question on Stack Overflow using the 
[Androidplot tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/androidplot).

# Tutorials
These tutorials are roughly in the order that they should be read.  Quickstart will get your app 
up and running with a basic xy plot.  Plot Composition explains the common anatomy of all plots
in the Androidplot library and lays the foundation for future topics.  The tutorials discuss 
specific plot types explaining styling and other advanced topics.
